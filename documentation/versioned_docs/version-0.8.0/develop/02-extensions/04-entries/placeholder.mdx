# Placeholder
Entries can expose a placeholder. 
The placeholders can be used by users or other plugins with the PlaceholderAPI.

:::danger
Placeholder is an additional interface for an existing entry. It cannot be used on its own. 
:::

## Basic Usage
To just expose a single placeholder, extend your entry with `PlaceholderEntry`:

<CodeSnippet tag="simple_placeholder_entry" json={require("../../snippets.json")} />

This placeholder can be used with `%typewriter_<entry id>%` and will return `Hello <player name>!`

## Sub Placeholders
Besides just having a primary placeholder, entries can also have sub placeholders.
These can be literal strings which needs to be matched:

<CodeSnippet tag="literal_placeholder_entry" json={require("../../snippets.json")} />

Where the placeholder can be used in the following ways:

| Placeholder | Result |
|------------|---------|
| `%typewriter_<entry id>%` | `Standard text` |
| `%typewriter_<entry id>:greet%` | `Hello, <player name>!` |
| `%typewriter_<entry id>:greet:enthusiastic%` | `HEY HOW IS YOUR DAY, <player name>!` |

But is can also have variables:

<CodeSnippet tag="string_placeholder_entry" json={require("../../snippets.json")} />

Where the placeholder can be used in the following ways:

| Placeholder | Result |
|------------|---------|
| `%typewriter_<entry id>%` | `%typewriter_<entry id>%` |
| `%typewriter_<entry id>:bob%` | `Hello, bob!` |
| `%typewriter_<entry id>:alice%` | `Hello, alice!` |

Notice how the default placeholder no longer works, because we don't have a supplier for it anymore.
