# Path Stream Displays
Today's beta update is fantastic! A long-requested feature has finally been implemented. I spent *way* too much time creating a video to explain and showcase everything (though I think it looks nice).

There are also some much-needed bug fixes. You can read about all the changes [here](https://typewriter.fibery.io/Milestone/Beta/Beta-161-88?sharing-key=29aec52b-35ac-45fa-8d2a-bb8b65104e3e).

Enjoy the update!
