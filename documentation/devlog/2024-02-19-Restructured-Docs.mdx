Hey reader, Marten here. Noticed how Gabber235 spends a ton of time on documentation? Well, I thought, why not help out with that so he can focus more on building cool stuff for the plugin?

If you've been checking out the Typewriter GitHub page's develop branch lately, you might've seen a bunch of new documentation. The cool part? We set it up to automatically generate whenever I push an update to the development branch. So, guess what? We've got a new documentation with the latest features for you!

# What got changed?
Let's break down the update:

* **Easy Version Switching**: Now, you can switch between Typewriter versions effortlessly to find exactly what you need. Super handy for those big updates like 4.0 or 5.0.

* **Fresh Look**: The documentation got a big update on the layout, matching the vibe of the latest beta version.

* **More Content, More Fun**: I've thrown in a bunch of new pages for you to read and improve your experience with Typewriter.

* **Installation Guide Makeover**: We've revamped the whole installation guide to make your life simpler. Installing the plugin should be a breeze with this new guide by your side.

The Typewriter documentation is now much more informative. Check it out, and improve your experience with Typewriter!
