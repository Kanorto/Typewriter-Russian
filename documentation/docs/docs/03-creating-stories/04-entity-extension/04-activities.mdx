# Entity Activities
:::info[Before you begin]
Make sure to read [Entities & NPCs](./index.mdx) before starting this tutorial.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to assign activities to your entities.

## What are activities?

By default, entities are static. Fortunately, activities can make them dynamic. For example, you can set up an activity that triggers when a player approaches the entity, or at specific moments—such as when the player talks to it. You can even use Road Networks to make entities travel between different nodes!

## Assigning an activity to an entity

In this tutorial, we’ll configure **Oliver** to automatically move along a Road Network. When a player interacts with him, he’ll stop and turn to face them.

To do this, we'll use an **In Dialogue Activity**, which lets you define two separate behaviors: one when the player is talking to the entity, and one for when they're not.

Let’s update Oliver’s instance by adding an `In Dialogue Activity`.
<EntrySearch entryName="in_dialogue_activity"/>

## Configuring the activity

The `In Dialogue Activity` controls two child activities, depending on whether or not the player is currently speaking to the entity.

- For the **Talking Activity**, we’ll use a `Look Close Activity`, so Oliver will look directly at the player during the conversation.
- For the **Idle Activity**, we’ll use a `Patrol Activity`, allowing Oliver to walk between the nodes of a Road Network.

If you haven’t created a Road Network yet, you can follow this tutorial: [Road Network](../road-network). You'll need to add the nodes you want by clicking on the <ActionButton button='capture'/> button.

## Final result

When a player interacts with Oliver, he will stop patrolling and turn to face them. Once the interaction ends, he will resume his patrol between the Road Network nodes.
