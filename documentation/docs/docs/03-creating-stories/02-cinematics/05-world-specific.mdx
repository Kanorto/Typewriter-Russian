# World Specific Cinematics
:::info[Before starting]
It's best to first read [Cinematics](./index.mdx) before starting this tutorial.
:::

In this tutorial, you will learn how to create world-specific cinematics. This feature allows you to create 1 cinematic that can be used in multiple worlds.

## Creating the dynamic variable
First, we need to create a dynamic variable. This variable will be used to determine which world the player is in. To do this please follow the these steps:
1. Go to your camera cinematic and click on a segment
2. Inside the segment at 1 of your paths click on the <ActionButton button='dynamic-variable'/> icon.
3. Search for `Player World Position Variable` and click on it to add it to your segment.

<EntrySearch entryName='player_world_position_variable'/>

### Configuring the dynamic variable
:::warning[repeat]
Repeat this step for all paths inside the camera cinematic segment.
:::
Now inside the inspector of the **camera cinematic segment** you can set the coordinates of your cinematic.

#### Where is the world value?
Good question, the world value is gone because we are using the `Player World Position Variable` to determine the world.\
The world the player is in will be the world used.

## Result
:::info[Entity]
For this guide we used an entity cinematic from the [entities](./03-entities.mdx) tutorial and an [actionbar dialogue](./01-dialogue.mdx). This is to demonstration the use of the dynamic variable.
