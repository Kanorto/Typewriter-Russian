# Questing

:::danger[Quest Extension]
You must have installed the Quest Extension before proceeding with any quest-related features.
:::
:::danger[Writers Note]
The questing section on our docs is currently being rewritten. If you want the old documentation that is complete read: [**Old Quest Documentation**](../../../../versioned_docs/version-0.7.0/docs/03-creating-stories/05-questing/index.mdx)

## Typewriter's Unique Approach to Quests

:::tip[The Big Idea]
In Typewriter, quests are **visual reflections** of your game state, not the drivers of it. Use permanent facts to track real progress, and let quests simply display that progress to players.
:::

<SplitLayout>
<Section>
### üîë Key Concept

Unlike traditional quest plugins where completing quests directly triggers progression, Typewriter separates:

- **Game State** - Facts that drive true progression
- **Quest Display** - What players see in the UI
</Section>

<Section divider="left">
### ‚öôÔ∏è How Quests Work

<FeatureHighlights 
  layout="horizontal"
  items={[
    {
      id: "inactive",
      title: "Inactive",
      color: "gray"
    },
    {
      id: "active",
      title: "Active",
      color: "sky"
    },
    {
      id: "completed",
      title: "Completed",
      color: "default"
    }
  ]}
/>

**Quest state is determined by:**

1. If **Completed Criteria** are met ‚Üí Completed
2. If **Active Criteria** are met ‚Üí Active
3. Otherwise ‚Üí Inactive
</Section>
</SplitLayout>
### üí™ Why This Is Powerful

<FeatureHighlights layout="grid" 
items={[
    {
      id: "dynamic",
      title: "üîÑ Dynamic Evolution",
      description: "When a player lingers without finding clues, change objective from **`Search for clues`** to **`Examine the bookshelf`**",
      color: "grayish"
    },
    {
      id: "interactive",
      title: "üîç Interactive Storytelling",
      description: "Display **`Search for clues`** only when players enter the crime scene area",
      color: "grayish"
    },
    {
      id: "branching",
      title: "üåø Branching Narratives",
      description: "Based on evidence found, objectives change to **`Confront the butler`** or **`Investigate the garden shed`**",
      color: "grayish"
    },
    {

      title: "üë§ Player History",

  }]}

## Creating a Quest
In Typewriter, quests are created using the **Quest** entry.
:::info[Quest Entry]
The Quest Entry is only a visual representation of the quest state. It does not affect the quest state itself.
:::
:::warning[Before Starting]
You must have a decent understanding of Typewriter's [**Facts**](../03-facts/index.mdx) and [**Interactions**](../01-interactions/index.mdx) before starting with creating quests.
:::
### Adding the Quest Entry
In the top right corner of the Typewriter editor, click on the **+** button and search for `Quest`. Click on the **+** button to add it to your page.

<EntrySearch entryName="quest" />

### Configuring the Quest Entry

<SplitLayout columns={3}>
<Section divider='right'>
<FeatureHighlights layout="horizontal" 
items={[{id: "display-name", title: "Display Name", color: "gray"}]}
/>
The name shown in player's quest log (e.g., **`QuestGuide`**)
</Section>
<Section divider="middle">
<FeatureHighlights layout="horizontal"
items={[{id: "active-criteria", title: "Active Criteria", color: "sky"}]}
/>
Condition for quest visibility (e.g., **`Permanent Fact >= 1`**)
</Section>
<Section divider="left">
<FeatureHighlights layout="horizontal"
items={[{id: "completed-criteria", title: "Completed Criteria", color: "default"}]}
/>
Condition for quest completion (e.g., **`Permanent Fact == 5`**)
</Section>
</SplitLayout>

## Adding objectives
You now have created a quest entry, but it doesn't have any objectives yet. For this documentation we have created multiple guides on how to do different objectives.
- **Talk to NPC**: Being written
- **Kill 10 Zombies**: Soon
- **Gather 10 Emeralds**: Soon
- **Give to Npc (Mail delivery)**: Soon

## Displaying the Quest
It is also possible to display the quest to players via placeholders. Read: **SOON** to learn more about this.
