# ActionEntry

The `ActionEntry` defines an action to take. When it is triggered, it will run it's `execute` method.
After which it will trigger all the next entries in the chain.

:::danger Immutable Entry
It is important to stress that the entry must be immutable.
**It cannot have any mutable state.**
:::

## Usage
<CodeSnippet tag="action_entry" json={require("../../../snippets.json")} />

Typewriter will automatically trigger the next entries in the chain after the `execute` method is called, and apply all the modifiers.

Sometimes you want to have a little more control over when the next triggers are triggered, or what triggers are triggered.

<CodeSnippet tag="action_entry_manual" json={require("../../../snippets.json")} />
