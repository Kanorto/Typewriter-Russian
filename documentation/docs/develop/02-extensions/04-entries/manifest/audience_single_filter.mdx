# SingleFilter

The `SingleFilter` is a specialized variant of `AudienceFilter` that ensures only one filter instance can be active for a player at any given time. This is particularly useful for managing exclusive displays like tab list headers/footers or scoreboard sidebars.

## Basic Usage

Here's a basic example of implementing a single filter:

<CodeSnippet tag="single_filter_basic" json={require("../../../snippets.json")} />

The `SingleFilter` consists of three main components:
1. An entry class that defines the configuration and creates the filter
2. A filter class that manages the shared state between instances
3. A display class that handles the player-specific display logic

## Display Lifecycle

The display lifecycle is a crucial concept in SingleFilter as it manages how displays are created, updated, and removed. Let's look at a practical example:

<CodeSnippet tag="single_filter_lifecycle" json={require("../../../snippets.json")} />

Let's walk through what happens in different scenarios:

### Scenario 1: Player Joins Server
```
1. Player joins
2. initialize() called once - Creates the display instance
3. setup() called - Activates the display with initial entry
4. tick() starts running periodically
```

### Scenario 2: Higher Priority Entry Becomes Active
```
1. New entry with higher priority includes player in its audience
2. tearDown() called on current display
3. setup() called with new entry
4. Same display instance continues, but with new entry reference
5. tick() continues running with new entry data
```

### Scenario 3: Player Leaves Entry's Audience
```
1. Player is filtered out of current entry's audience
2. System looks for next highest priority entry where player is in audience
3. If found:
   - tearDown() called with old entry
   - setup() called with new entry
   - Display continues with new entry
4. If not found:
   - tearDown() called
   - dispose() called
   - Display is completely removed
```

The display lifecycle ensures smooth transitions between different entries while maintaining the single display state. This is particularly important for exclusive displays where you want to avoid flickering or interruptions when switching between different configurations.

### Priority Behavior

The priority of entries determines which display becomes active when multiple entries include a player in their audience. For example:

```kotlin
Entry A (priority: 50) - Basic display
Entry B (priority: 100) - Special display

Scenario:
1. Player joins -> Entry B becomes active (higher priority)
2. Player leaves Entry B's audience -> Entry A becomes active (next highest)
3. Player returns to Entry B's audience -> Switches back to Entry B
```

This priority system ensures that more important displays can temporarily override less important ones, while maintaining a fallback when a player is no longer in the audience of higher priority entries.
