# AudienceFilter

The `AudienceFilterEntry` is a specialized version of `AudienceEntry` designed to filter audience members based on specific criteria.
It accepts a list of children that can include both `AudienceEntry` and `AudienceFilterEntry` components.

## Basic Usage

### Static Filtering
Here's an example of a filter that only allows players whose names start with 'g':

<CodeSnippet tag="audience_filter" json={require("../../../snippets.json")} />

This filter is static because player names cannot be changed while on the server.
Players are either filtered at the start or not at all.

### Dynamic Filtering
For more dynamic filtering, you can filter based on changing player attributes, such as health:

<CodeSnippet tag="audience_filter_dynamic" json={require("../../../snippets.json")} />

This example filters players based on their health value, which is provided as a parameter from the entry.
Like `AudienceDisplay`, we can use both Bukkit events and `TickableDisplay` to update which players pass through the filter.

### Invertible Filters
Sometimes you may want to invert a filter's behavior.
This is particularly useful when the opposite condition would be complex to define explicitly, such as filtering all players that are not in a specific world:

<CodeSnippet tag="audience_filter_invertable" json={require("../../../snippets.json")} />

Simply implementing the `Invertible` interface enables this functionality in Typewriter.
