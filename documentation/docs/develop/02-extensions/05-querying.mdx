# Query Entries

Sometimes you need to find an entry by any of it's fields or by type. This can be done with the `Query` class.

If you need to find all entries of a specific type:
<CodeSnippet tag="query_multiple" json={require("../snippets.json")} />

Sometimes you need it by a specific filter:
<CodeSnippet tag="query_multiple_with_filter" json={require("../snippets.json")} />


Sometimes you need to find an entry by it's id:
<CodeSnippet tag="query_by_id" json={require("../snippets.json")} />

Other times you need to find entries by their page:
<CodeSnippet tag="query_from_page" json={require("../snippets.json")} />
