# Triggering Entries

There are easy ways to trigger all the next entries in a `TriggerEntry`.
The most important is that you have a `player` to trigger the entries on.

:::info
Typewriter takes care of only triggering the entries that should be triggered.
If criteria are not met, the entries are not triggered.
:::

If you have a single `TriggerEntry`:
<CodeSnippet tag="trigger_without_context" json={require("../snippets.json")} />

Sometimes you don't want to trigger the entries when the player is in a dialogue.
For example, when the player is in a dialogue with a NPC, you don't want to trigger the first entry of the NPC again.
You expect when the player clicks on the NPC again, the next dialogue is triggered.
To facilitate this, you can use the `startDialogueWithOrNextDialogue` function.

<CodeSnippet tag="start_dialogue_with_or_trigger" json={require("../snippets.json")} />

Previously, we triggered entries with a new fresh `context`, but sometimes we already have a context.
Then you need to make sure that you pass on the context to the trigger.

<CodeSnippet tag="trigger_with_context" json={require("../snippets.json")} />

## Custom triggers
Typewriter triggers based on the `EventTrigger` interface.
So all the entries that are triggered are wrapped in a `EntryTrigger`.

### System Triggers

For some interactions there are custom triggers that are defined in Typewriter.
These triggers allow you to do special things with the interaction.

<CodeSnippet tag="interaction_triggers" json={require("../snippets.json")} />

#### Dialogue Interaction


<CodeSnippet tag="dialogue_triggers" json={require("../snippets.json")} />

#### Temporal Interaction

<CodeSnippet tag="temporal_triggers" json={require("../snippets.json")} />
