# Interaction System

The Interaction system provides a framework for managing stateful player interactions that need to run over time.
Examples include cinematics, conversations, or custom game modes.
The system consists of two main components: Trigger Handlers, and Interactions.

:::info
At any given moment, a player can only be in one interaction at a time.
Regardless of Interaction type. If you need multiple interactions, you can use the [AudienceEntry](entries/manifest/audience) to manage them.

## Core Concepts

An Interaction follows a specific lifecycle:
1. An Entry raises an event with a start trigger
2. A TriggerHandler processes this event and creates the Interaction
3. The Interaction is initialized and begins ticking
4. When the Interaction should end, it raises a stop trigger
5. The TriggerHandler processes the stop trigger and ends the Interaction

## Basic Implementation

Here's a basic example of implementing an interaction:

<CodeSnippet tag="basic_interaction" json={require("../../snippets.json")} />

The Interaction class handles the actual state and behavior. Key points:
- `initialize()` sets up the initial state
- `tick()` updates the state over time
- `teardown()` cleans up when the interaction ends
- Priority comes from the entry that started the interaction

## Trigger System

The trigger system manages starting and stopping interactions.

Interaction should be started by raising its specific start trigger.
And they can be gracefully stopped by raising its specific stop trigger.

<CodeSnippet tag="interaction_triggers" json={require("../../snippets.json")} />

### Trigger Handlers

The handler is responsible for:
1. Creating new interactions from start triggers
2. Ending interactions when stop triggers are received

Though it could also change things on the current interaction. 
For example, it could swap out the dialogue.

<CodeSnippet tag="interaction_trigger_handler" json={require("../../snippets.json")} />

## Activating the interaction

Something needs to start the interaction.
This could be any entry.
For this example, we have an action entry which when triggered starts the interaction.

<CodeSnippet tag="interaction_entry" json={require("../../snippets.json")} />

## Flow Example

Here's how everything works together:

```
1. Player triggers ExampleInteractionActionEntry
2. Entry creates ExampleStartTrigger
3. ExampleTriggerHandler receives the trigger
4. Handler creates ExampleInteraction
5. Interaction get initialized (automatically)
6. Interaction runs until end condition met
7. Interaction raises ExampleStopTrigger
8. Handler processes stop trigger
9. Interaction teardown is called (automatically)
```

## Priority System

Some interactions are more important than others. 
Since only 1 interaction can be active at a time, the priority system ensures that the most important interactions will be active.
To make sure that some random idle dialogue doesn't interrupt a story critical cinematic.

An interaction can only be started if the priority of the running interaction is lower or equal to the new interaction.

For example, if the player is in a cinematic with priority 1, and some idle dialogue with priority 0 is triggered, the idle dialogue will not interrupt the cinematic.
