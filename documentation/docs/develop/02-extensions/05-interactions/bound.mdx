# Interaction Bound

The InteractionBounds allows you to constrain the lifetime of an interactions to specific conditions, such as player location or actions. 
For example, a player staying within range of an NPC during a conversation or while they are sitting on a bench.

## States and Behavior

InteractionBounds operate in three states:

1. **INTERRUPTING**: When the bound condition is broken (e.g., player moves too far), the interaction ends
2. **BLOCKING**: Prevents the bound from being broken (e.g., cancels movement beyond the allowed range)
3. **IGNORING**: Bound conditions are not enforced (e.g., player can move freely)

:::warning
The bound itself doesn't determine the state - it only responds to the current state provided by the system.

## Implementation

Here's how to create a interaction bound:

<CodeSnippet tag="interaction_bound" json={require("../../snippets.json")} />

## Implementation Tips

1. Always use `handleEvent()` for consistent state handling
2. Check player UUID to ensure you're handling the right player
3. Clean up resources in `teardown()`
4. Consider performance for frequently triggered events

## Example Flow

Here's how a typical radius bound might work:

```
1. Player starts interaction
2. Bound initializes with start location
3. Player moves:
   - Within range: No action
   - Beyond range:
     - If BLOCKING: Cancel movement
     - If INTERRUPTING: End interaction
     - If IGNORING: Allow movement
4. Interaction ends, bound tears down
```
