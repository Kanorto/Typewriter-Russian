        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hey reader! After many months of development, the day has finally arrived: a new Typewriter release! Interactions like dialogue or cinematics have gained many new capabilities.</p>
<!-- -->
<h1>Interaction Bounds</h1>
<p>Interaction bounds confine interactions to an action or space, such as canceling dialogue when the player walks away.
Interaction bounds can be in 2 modes:&nbsp;<code>Interrupting</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>Blocking</code>.
<code>Interruption Mode</code>&nbsp;means that if the player breaks the bounding condition, the interaction will be canceled.
<code>Blocking Mode</code>&nbsp;means the player is not allowed to violate the bounding condition, ensuring players see the dialogue through.</p>
<p>The mode is determined by the priority of the interaction versus the priority of the bound. If the interaction has a higher priority, it is in&nbsp;<code>Blocking Mode</code>; if it is the same or lower priority, it is in&nbsp;<code>Interruption Mode</code>.
Entries inherit their priority from the page.</p>
<p>Some examples of Interaction Bounds are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>PlayerRadiusInteractionBound</code>: Player stays within a certain radius from when the bound started.</li>
<li><code>LookAtNpcInteractionBound</code>: Similar to&nbsp;<code>PlayerRadiusInteractionBound</code>&nbsp;but forces the player to look at the entity.</li>
<li><code>LockInteractionBound</code>: Completely locks the player's camera from moving and rotating.</li>
<li><code>CommandInteractionBound</code>: Triggered when the player runs a command other than the&nbsp;<code>/tw</code>&nbsp;command.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Interaction Context</h1>
<p>The second new concept is&nbsp;<code>Interaction Context</code>. This allows you to pass variables to subsequent entries in a sequence, allowing for more flexible interactions, such as asking the user for input and using that later, or spawning something on the block the player clicked on.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="custom-commands">Custom Commands<a href="https://docs.typewritermc.com/devlog/0.8.0-release#custom-commands" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Custom Commands" title="Direct link to Custom Commands">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>Though you could already have Typewriter create a custom command, you can now have arguments for this command and use the input of the arguments in subsequent entries.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="inputdialogue">InputDialogue<a href="https://docs.typewritermc.com/devlog/0.8.0-release#inputdialogue" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to InputDialogue" title="Direct link to InputDialogue">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>NPCs can now ask more open-ended questions, like how many cookies üç™ you want to have baked, or asking for a certain phrase like a password.</p>
<h1>Other Features</h1>
<p>This is not the only thing we added. Some noteworthy new features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Speed Data</strong>: You can now specify how fast/slow an NPC should walk.</li>
<li><strong>Replace With ‚Ä¶ Button</strong>: Now in the web panel, you can replace an existing entry with a different one. This is particularly useful!</li>
<li><strong>Improved Navigation for long cinematic content modes</strong></li>
<li><strong>Allow glowing effect data to have colors</strong></li>
<li>And 70+ more new features!</li>
</ul>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hey reader! After weeks of development, I'm thrilled to introduce Dynamic Variables - a system that lets your content adapt during gameplay.</p>
<!-- -->
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-are-dynamic-variables">What are Dynamic Variables<a href="https://docs.typewritermc.com/devlog/0.7.0-release#what-are-dynamic-variables" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What are Dynamic Variables" title="Direct link to What are Dynamic Variables">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>Before, all fields on an entry needed to be filled in with valid values during configuration time.
With Dynamic variables, fields can now be substituted with runtime values.</p>
<p>To give you some inspiration of what you can now do:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Have cinematics in the world the player is in, instead of in a fixed world. Which is useful for playing cinematics in generated dungeons.</strong></li>
<li>Have the skin of a NPC be determined from a placeholder. For making leaderboard NPCs.</li>
<li>Having the strength of a potion effect be the value of a fact. For "upgradable skills."</li>
<li>Making launch pads shoot the player in the direction where they are looking.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes you want to know different details of an entry. Like the time it last got updated. The remaining time until the fact resets.
Entries now support parameterized placeholders for more detailed information:</p>
<div class="language-text codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#000000;--prism-background-color:#ffffff"><div class="codeBlockContent_QJqH"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#000000;background-color:#ffffff"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#000000"><span class="token plain">%typewriter_&lt;entry id&gt;:remaining:10%     // Items left to collect</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#000000"><span class="token plain">%typewriter_&lt;entry id&gt;:time:expires:relative%     // Time until daily quest is active</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="critical-changes">Critical Changes<a href="https://docs.typewritermc.com/devlog/0.6.0-release#critical-changes" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Critical Changes" title="Direct link to Critical Changes">‚Äã</a></h2>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="from-adapters-to-extensions">From Adapters to Extensions<a href="https://docs.typewritermc.com/devlog/0.6.0-release#from-adapters-to-extensions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to From Adapters to Extensions" title="Direct link to From Adapters to Extensions">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>Typewriter has transitioned from using <code>Adapters</code> to <code>Extensions</code>, marking a significant evolution in how custom functionality is integrated. Key improvements with this change include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gradle Plugin for Extensions</strong>: A new Gradle plugin simplifies the process of developing Extensions, making setup and management easier for developers.</li>
<li><strong>Compile-Time Discovery</strong>: Discovery of Extension internals, such as entries, now occurs at compile-time instead of runtime. This not only future-proofs Typewriter but also lays the groundwork for the upcoming marketplace, where entries in each Extension will be viewable without running the Extension.</li>
<li><strong>Hot Reloading</strong>: Extensions can now be reloaded on-the-fly using <code>/tw reload</code>, enabling real-time updates without the need for a server restart.</li>
<li><strong>Optimized Loading</strong>: Only the necessary classes are loaded from Extensions. For example, if an Extension contains thousands of entries but only one is used, Typewriter loads only that specific entry, enhancing memory and processing efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Extension Validators</strong>: Built-in validators now check Extensions against Typewriter‚Äôs standards, helping to ensure reliability and consistency across user-created Extensions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="new-item-system">New Item System<a href="https://docs.typewritermc.com/devlog/0.6.0-release#new-item-system" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to New Item System" title="Direct link to New Item System">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>Typewriter introduces a completely new item system, which is <strong>incompatible with previously defined items</strong>. Users will need to recreate items to align with the new structure. Based on user feedback, no migrator will be provided, as the majority found it unnecessary. <strong>Please test this update on a development server before upgrading your production environment.</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Skip Cinematic Segments</strong><br>
<!-- -->A new <code>SkipCinematicEntry</code> gives players the option to skip sections of cinematics by pressing a configured key, offering more control over in-game cinematic experiences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>UI and Web Panel Upgrades</strong><br>
<!-- -->Improvements to the web panel and UI components provide a smoother experience. These upgrades include the ability to unselect Sound IDs, layout enhancements, compatibility improvements behind reverse proxies, and visual indicators for empty fields, all of which contribute to a more intuitive and flexible panel.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since this update is so big, it is almost impossible to list every change. Therefore, only the biggest changes are listed.</p>
<p>With <strong>729</strong> commits, <strong>1,438</strong> changed files, with <strong>60,258</strong> additions and <strong>33,483</strong> deletions, this is by far the biggest update in the history of Typewriter.</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="manifest-entries">Manifest Entries<a href="https://docs.typewritermc.com/devlog/0.5.0-release#manifest-entries" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Manifest Entries" title="Direct link to Manifest Entries">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>Manifest entries are entries that automatically do stuff based on the environment. Think of showing NPCs based on filters (such as quest status) and having NPC holograms. Boss bars, Creating scoreboards, Interaction zones, and much more!</p>
<p><em>For the programmers under us, where sequence entries are like imperative programming. Manifest entries are declarative programming. They can be linked in an acyclic-directional graph.</em></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="audience-entries">Audience Entries<a href="https://docs.typewritermc.com/devlog/0.5.0-release#audience-entries" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Audience Entries" title="Direct link to Audience Entries">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>The first subclass of Manifest Entries are Audience Entries.
They display anything to the player, Such as a boss bar. There is a special variety of audience entries, which are AudienceFilterEntries. They filter out players, such as regions, if they are in a certain part of a quest, if they are in a cinematic...
These types of filters can be chained to have extreme customizability and flexibility.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="entity-adapter">Entity Adapter<a href="https://docs.typewritermc.com/devlog/0.5.0-release#entity-adapter" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Entity Adapter" title="Direct link to Entity Adapter">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>Say goodbye to the old NPC adapters like Citizens, FancyNpcs, and ZNPCs. The Entity Adapter allows you to define entities directly within Typewriter, empowering you to use them in cinematics, control their visibility based on conditions (like during a quest segment), and even have them navigate and exhibit complex behaviors. With full control, the sky is the limit!</p>

<p>You can now create <strong>Road Networks</strong> in Typewriter.
These allow NPCs to navigate through the world and show Path Streams to guide the players.</p>

<p>The value of a fact can now be set for a group of players.
For example, you can now check if a party of players have killed a certain number of enemies.</p>

<p>Some of you may have already looked at the new documentation.
We've made major improvements to the documentation. All to make it easier to use and understand Typewriter.</p>

<p>This switch has allowed many new features in Typewriter, like the new buttery smooth camera cinematics. It means that now you need to install PacketEvents in order for Typewriter to work.</p>

It will remain updated primarily to assist new users in getting started, but we strongly encourage everyone to transition to the Entity Adapter for the best Typewriter experience.</p></div></div>]]></content>

<p>Hello there, Minecraft enthusiasts! My name is Gabber235, and for the past 10 years I've been creating Minecraft content. I've made a variety of different projects, from simple tweaks to complex interactions. And while I've always enjoyed creating these projects, I've always found that creating custom player interactions was a pain.</p>
<!-- -->
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-problem">The problem<a href="https://docs.typewritermc.com/devlog/why-i-created-typewriter#the-problem" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The problem" title="Direct link to The problem">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>You see, I love telling stories in Minecraft. Bringing my wildest ideas to life in a virtual world is one of my greatest joys.
However, actually creating these stories was a different story üòÜ. Not only did it require a lot of time and effort, but I also had to be an expert coder to make anything happen.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-does-typewriter-help">How does Typewriter help?<a href="https://docs.typewritermc.com/devlog/why-i-created-typewriter#how-does-typewriter-help" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How does Typewriter help?" title="Direct link to How does Typewriter help?">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>With Typewriter, I wanted to provide a tool that was accessible and easy to use, even for those who have no coding experience. I wanted to help reduce the complexity and time required to create custom player interactions, allowing server owners to focus on other aspects of their projects. Letting them create the stories they want to tell, without having to worry about the technical side of things.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="there-are-already-a-lot-of-tools-out-there-why-create-another-one">There are already a lot of tools out there, why create another one?<a href="https://docs.typewritermc.com/devlog/why-i-created-typewriter#there-are-already-a-lot-of-tools-out-there-why-create-another-one" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to There are already a lot of tools out there, why create another one?" title="Direct link to There are already a lot of tools out there, why create another one?">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>Now, I know what you're thinking. "But Gabber, why not just use an existing tool?" Well, I tried. But I always found that existing tools were either too complex, requiring you to navigate way to many YAML files, or not flexible enough, leaving me with untold possibilities.
That is why I created Typewriter, a tool that is easy to use, but also flexible enough to be used for a variety of different Minecraft projects, from simple tweaks to complex interactions. With a unique web panel and a powerful API, Typewriter is the perfect tool for creating custom player interactions.</p>
